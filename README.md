# React-Blog

Blog app using React-Readux. You can post your own stuff easily!

You can navigate through a list of posts, read one at a time, delete it, or even create new posts.

## Getting started

Recommended settings:
* macOS 10.12
* nodejs 7.4.9 && npm 4.1.2

Execute these on the project directory:

```
> yarn install
> yarn start
```

If you're not as freak as me and you don't have [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn), use this instead:

```
> npm install
> npm start
```

Now navigate to [http://localhost:8080]() and voil√†!
